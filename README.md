WindowSnaps
===========

[WindowSnaps Logo](Logo.png) [Before and after snapping](BeforeAfter.png)

A simple OSX addon that will "snap" windows you drag to the left or right screen edge, much like in the Windows desktop environments. The logo is tacky, but this is a pretty helpful utility.

Author's Comments
-----------------

I wrote this small tool simply because I find the window-snap feature of Windows Vista+ really helpful when
reviewing multiple documents. OSX's windowing system can easily overwhelm users who use multiple applications at once,
and having to manually move and resize a window is tedious. This app is specifically designed to help you out with that.

Change Log
==========

Version 1.0; Jan 17th 2013

+ Initial public release; no formal build (You must build locally)
+ Left, right, and top windowing will snap
+ A little two-item menu exists (The app runs with a magnet icon in the user's top-menu bar)
+ Multi-screen support (though we will snap based on any screen's edge, even if you extend the desktop to multiple physical monitors)
